# Line Follower
Code for the line follower bot for the Raspberry Pi 5 and Arduino Uno.

## Getting Started
For the Raspberry Pi 5, you will need to be able to access the Desktop of it. A few sources are here which will help you get started:

* [Access desktop via mac](github.com/hi-anvi/raspberry-pi)
* [Access desktop via monitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH6vfvRstfM)

If you have access, you just need to save the code in it.
Same for Arduino.

Note: For Arduino the code with .cpp extention is needed while the one for the pi 5 id .py

### Circuit Diagrams

After fixing in the code, here are the circuit diagram for Arduino for the codes.

For the Arduino: <img width="1146" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08c95649-6bfb-4bcf-babc-1ce5d93acf16" />

For the pi, the numbers are the gpio pins.
